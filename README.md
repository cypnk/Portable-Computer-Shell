# Portable Computer Shell
A set of 3D printable enclosure designs for a DIY computer

This is a generic enclosure which is meant for hobbyist use. The side compartments support BL-5C type batteries and pathways are made to the center compartment which can hold the main electronics. The keyboard supports Cherry MX style keyswitches and Costar stabilizers. The cover/lid can support a monitor, or other type of display, or can be left as-is. The lid can be attached to the main body with off-the-shelf friction hinges.

* [switch.stl](https://github.com/cypnk/Portable-Computer-Shell/blob/master/switch.stl) - The keyboard switchplate
* [bottom.stl](https://github.com/cypnk/Portable-Computer-Shell/blob/master/bottom.stl) - The last layer of the keyboard side with screw holes
* [cover.stl](https://github.com/cypnk/Portable-Computer-Shell/blob/master/cover.stl) - The lid of the shell, with an opening for a connector

To ensure proper scaling before printing, make sure the switch cutout size is exactly 14 x 14mm. The rest of the enclosure should proportionally match after that.

The bottom layer has pathways for connecting to batteries in the side compartments as well as an entry into the keyboard well. There is an additional cutout to wire up to the cover and there are weep holes to prevent retention of any spilled liquids. The pathways to the main compartment can be sealed with silicone to prevent ingress of moisture from the keyboard well.

Screws used to attach all three bottom layers must be tall enough to reach the top plate, but short enough to not portrude too much from the end.
